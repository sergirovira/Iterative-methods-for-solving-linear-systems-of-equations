The following files are included in this repository:

#[iterativeMethods.c](https://github.com/sergirovira/iterative-methods-for-solving-linear-systems-of-equations/iterativeMethods.c)#

It contains the following methods:

- Jacobi
- Gauss-Seidel
- Successive over-relaxation

A concrete example has been implemented, in order to adapt
to you linear system read the comments in the code.

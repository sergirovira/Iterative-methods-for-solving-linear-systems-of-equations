The following files are included in this repository:

#[iterativeMethods.c](https://github.com/sergirovira/Iterative-methods-for-solving-linear-systems-of-equations/blob/master/iterationMethods.c)#

It contains the following methods:

- Jacobi
- Gauss-Seidel
- Successive over-relaxation

A concrete example has been implemented, in order to adapt
to you linear system read the comments in the code.

#[steepestDescent.c](https://github.com/sergirovira/Iterative-methods-for-solving-linear-systems-of-equations/blob/master/steepestDescent.c)#

It implements the iterative method steepest descent. 

#[functions.c](https://github.com/sergirovira/Iterative-methods-for-solving-linear-systems-of-equations/blob/master/funcions.c)#

It contains different functions which help with
computation and vector visualization.
